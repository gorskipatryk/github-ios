This app has meant to be an tumblr client, but due to GDPR resposne from tubmlr API I've made a decision to make a GitHub client for iOS. I've tried to refactor everything, but maybe somewhere you can still see some "tumblr" names. Also be advised that the free GitHub API has some limits, which may affect work of search engine in the app - just try to avoid searching for 1000 queries per minute and it will be fine :)
